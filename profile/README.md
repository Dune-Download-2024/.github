The No. 1 film this weekend is expected to be Warner Bros./DC’s “Dune: Part Two,” a sequel to James Wan’s $1.15 billion superhero hit released back in 2018. “Dune: Part Two” earned an opening weekend of $67 million five years ago and reached $100 million in domestic grosses after Christmas Day two days later.

According to Forbes, the official budget for Dune: Part Two is over $274.8 million, making it one of the most expensive MCU films to date.

This comes as a bit of a surprise seeing as how the movie is only rumored to be around 100 minutes in length (however that has not been confirmed as of yet), but the high cost is likely due to the extensive VFX work that will go into bringing it to life.

However, Forbes also reported that Disney received a $55 million subsidy from the United Kingdom government while making the film, bringing the total amount spent on Dune: Part Two down to around $220 million.

In comparison the the budgets of other MCU films, this $274.8 million mark makes Dune: Part Two the fourth-expensive movie in the entirety of the MCU.
The Greatest Night in Pop came in third place in its fourth weekend, down 29% with $6.1 million, emerging as one of the season’s most durable grossers and one of the year’s few bright spots when it comes to films
